# CSS filter: blur() Clipping Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where the CSS `filter: blur()` property doesn't apply correctly to elements with large background images.  The blur effect may be unexpectedly clipped or not visible in some browsers.

The `bug.css` file shows the problematic CSS.  The `solution.css` provides a potential workaround.  See the files for details and a comparison.
